# Angel Perez (AITBW)'s dotfiles

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

If you're reading this, welcome to my repo that hosts my dotfiles â€” that is,
the way I like my Linux. Please, feel free to use this repo as a template and/or
inspiration to configure your Linux your way, but do not use it blindly (even
if you know me IRL). I encourage you to go file-by-file to understand how this
setup will impact your experience.
